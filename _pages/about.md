I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate in the [Department of Mathematics](https://math.nyu.edu/) at the [Courant Institute for Mathematical Sciences](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/) at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/). I am working with [Sara Shamekh](https://sshamekh.com/) and [Pierre Gentine](https://www.eee.columbia.edu/faculty/pierre-gentine) on deep learning approaches for parameterization of planetary boundary layer turbulence and low clouds in climate models.

You can find more information about me on [my resume](assets/pdf/resume.pdf).
